Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps. 
-   It’s kind of like Creat React App – preconfigured toolchain for building React apps. 
-	It’s kind of like Next.js – a React web framework for building pre-rendered React apps for SEO & SPEED. 
-	It’s kind of like Staic Site Generators in that what you deploy is static files onto a CDN for SPEED.
-	It’s kind of like WordPress & Drupal that people primarily use to build web properties on the website side of the spectrum
-	It generates PWAs, so a PWA framework ?
-	It’s kind of like an operating system in that its job isn’t to do anything in particular – Gatsby coordinates plugins & othe services doing their work

The fundamental architecture of the internet is changing from the LAMP stack to Cloud/Serverless.

Gatsby
-	aggregates data from nultiple sources (the content mesh)
