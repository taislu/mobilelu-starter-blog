Should you use vanilla CSS (**no framework**), a component framework like Bootstrap or a utility framework like Tailwind CSS? All three approaches allow you to style your page but there are important differences you must consider when making the decision.   

**Vanilla CSS** : **write** all your styles and layouts on your own    
**Bootstrap** : **choose** from a rich suite of pre-styled components & utility features/ classes    
**Tailwind CSS** : **build** your own styles and layouts with the help of utility fratures and classes
