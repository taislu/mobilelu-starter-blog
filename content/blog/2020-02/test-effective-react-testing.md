Building applications with React is a cinch these days. But what about testing? In this talk, learn how to create an effective plan for testing a React and Redux application from the ground up. You will learn about the testing framework **Jest**, how to unit test React components with logic, the magic and trade-offs of **snapshot testing**, how to test Redux, and how to end-to-end test your entire application with **cypress**. You will leave this talk ready to effectively test your React applications.
