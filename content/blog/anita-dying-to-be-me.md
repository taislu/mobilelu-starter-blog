Doctors had given **Anita Moorjani** just hours to live when she arrived at the hospital in a coma on the morning of **February 2nd, 2006**. 

Unable to move as a result of the cancer that had ravaged her body for almost four years, Anita entered **another dimension**, where she experienced great clarity and understanding of her life and purpose here on earth. She was given a choice of whether to return to life or not, and chose to return to life when she realized that "heaven" is a state and not a place. This subsequently resulted in a remarkable and complete recovery of her health. 

Anita's riveting talk will inspire you to **transform your life** by living more authentically, discovering your greatest passions, transcending your deepest fears, and living from a place of pure joy.
